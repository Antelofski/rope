Your task is to generate a Python program that implements a fully functional Connect 4 game. The game should be intuitive, user-friendly, and visually engaging. 

**Objective:**

Create a Python script that will allow two players to play Connect 4 in the console, featuring a 6x7 grid. The game should handle player turns, highlight the selected column during the player's turn, and automatically place their piece in the lowest available row of that column. The game should also be capable of detecting when a player has won, by checking for four consecutive pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, and declare the winner by drawing a line through the four pieces. If the board is full and no player has won, it should declare a tie. At the end of the game, provide an option for the players to restart the game.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Create the Game Board:**
   - Initialize a 6x7 grid to represent the Connect 4 board.
   - Display ""Connect 4"" at the top of the board.
   - Implement a function to print the board after every move, ensuring that each cell is clearly defined.

2. **Implement Player Interaction:**
   - Create a system to manage player turns, alternating between ""X"" and ""O"".
   - Highlight the current column under the cursor as the player selects a column.
   - Display a message indicating ""X's turn"" or ""O's turn"" to guide the players.
   - Allow the player to select a column and place their piece in the lowest available row within that column.

3. **Game Logic:**
   - Implement a function to check if a player has won by connecting four pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
   - If a winning combination is found, highlight the four winning pieces by drawing a line through them and announce the winner.

4. **Game Over Handling:**
   - Implement a function to check if the board is full. If the board is full and no player has won, declare the game as a tie.
   - After declaring a winner or a tie, display a ""Game Over"" message with an option to restart the game.

5. **Restart Option:**
   - Provide an option for the players to start a new game or exit after the current game ends.

Act like a highly experienced Python developer and game strategy expert. You have extensive knowledge in developing interactive applications, particularly games with turn-based mechanics. You specialize in writing Python code that implements sophisticated logic for game AI, ensuring the AI can anticipate moves, block potential threats, and dynamically adapt to changing conditions in real-time.

**Objective:**
Your task is to generate Python code that simulates a strategic game where two players take turns placing buttons in available boxes on a grid. The primary objective is to prevent the opponent from getting three buttons in a row in any direction—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The AI must constantly assess the game state, anticipate future moves, and take necessary actions to block the opponent's strategy.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Initialize the Game Board:**
   - Create a 3x3 grid (list of lists) representing the game board.
   - Ensure each cell in the grid can hold a button, which will be represented by a unique identifier (e.g., 'X' for player 1 and 'O' for player 2).

2. **Player Turns and Button Placement:**
   - Implement a function for alternating turns between the two players. The function should place a button in any available box on the grid.
   - Ensure that each button placed uses a different color (or symbol) than the previous button. For instance, if player 1 places an 'X', player 2 must place an 'O'.

3. **Strategic Move Blocking:**
   - Develop an AI strategy that checks for any instance where the opponent has two buttons in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - If such a scenario is detected, the AI should immediately place its button in the empty spot to block the opponent from completing three in a row.

4. **Anticipating and Countering Future Moves:**
   - Implement logic to anticipate the opponent’s potential moves by simulating possible future board states.
   - The AI should prioritize moves that prevent the opponent from achieving three in a row in subsequent turns.
   - Ensure that the AI double-checks all possible winning and blocking scenarios before finalizing its move.

5. **Game End Condition:**
   - Write a function that checks if either player has achieved three in a row after each move.
   - If a player wins, declare the winner and end the game. If the grid is full with no winner, declare a draw.

6. **Final Implementation:**
   - Assemble all functions into a cohesive Python script that runs the game in a loop until a win or draw condition is met.
   - Include comments in the code to explain each function’s purpose and logic flow.

**Objective:** Help me build an interactive Connect4 game using Python. The game should be web-based, visually appealing, and fully functional with clear game logic and user interactions.

**Task Overview:**

1. **Set Up the Game Interface:**
   - Create a simple web page structure.
   - At the top, place a bold title that reads **""Connect 4""**.
   - Below the title, include a status text area that will dynamically display game status updates (e.g., ""X's turn"", ""O's turn"", ""X wins! (press 'r' to restart)"", etc.).
   - Render a 6x7 grid (6 rows and 7 columns) beneath the status area. The grid should have clearly defined cells with black borders, each cell starting empty.

2. **Game Logic and Status Management:**
   - Implement game logic that alternates turns between two players, X and O. The status text should clearly indicate whose turn it is.
   - The game should recognize and announce a win when a player gets four of their marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Upon a win, the status text should update to reflect the winner (e.g., ""X wins! (press 'r' to restart)"").
   - If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game should declare a draw and prompt a restart.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Implement a feature where hovering over a column highlights the entire column in a sky-blue color, giving visual feedback on where the player's piece will drop.
   - When a user clicks on a column, the piece (X or O) should drop to the lowest available cell in that column.
   - Ensure that the game correctly alternates turns between X and O after each move.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - Define and implement the conditions for winning. The game should check after each move whether there are four consecutive X’s or O’s in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
   - Once a winning condition is met, the game should immediately stop further play, display the winning message, and prompt for a restart.

5. **Restart Functionality:**
   - Implement a restart feature where pressing the 'r' key will refresh the game board.
   - Upon restarting, the game should clear all pieces, reset the turn to X, and update the status text to indicate that it’s X’s turn.

The game area should consist of a 6x7 grid, where each square is of equal size. The background should be white, and the grid should be clearly outlined.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **Game Interface:**
   - Display the game's name at the top center of the window.
   - Display the current player’s turn (Player X or Player O) beneath the game's name, updating after each move.
   - The game area must be a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns, where each cell is a square. Ensure all squares are equal in size.
   - The background of the entire interface should be white.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - There are two players: Player X and Player O.
   - When it is Player X’s turn, allow the player to select a column. An ""X"" should appear in the first available square from the bottom of the selected column.
   - After Player X’s move, it becomes Player O's turn. The same logic applies, but an ""O"" appears instead of an ""X"".
   - The game continues until one player has four of their symbols in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). 

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - Detect when a player has won by forming a straight line of four adjacent symbols.
   - When a player wins, draw a line through the four winning squares to visually indicate the win.
   - Display a message at the top of the interface in red text indicating the winner (e.g., ""Player X wins!"").
   - Prompt the user to restart the game by pressing the ""r"" key.

4. **Game Reset:**
   - Implement functionality to reset the game to its initial state when the ""r"" key is pressed. All grid squares should be cleared, and the game should be ready for a new match.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use appropriate libraries (e.g., `tkinter` or `pygame`) for creating the GUI.
- Ensure the code is well-structured, with functions for handling different aspects of the game (e.g., handling user input, updating the display, checking for a win, etc.).
- Comment your code thoroughly to explain the logic behind each function and the main sections of the code.

**Output Only:** Generate the Python code that meets the above specifications. Do not include any explanations, comments, or output other than the required code.

---

### Step 1: Design the Tic-Tac-Toe Grid

- **Grid Dimensions:** Create a 3x3 grid.
- **Grid Lines:** The grid lines should be clearly visible, ideally in a dark color such as black or dark gray.
- **Caption:** Display a caption at the top of the window that reads ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" in bold black font. Ensure this caption is always visible and centered.
- **Mouse Interaction:** When the mouse cursor hovers over any square in the grid, highlight that square by changing its background color to yellow. Ensure this visual feedback is responsive and smooth.

### Step 2: Design the Game Pieces

- **Piece Design:** Use circles to represent the game pieces.
  - **Red Pieces:** Represent player one.
  - **Blue Pieces:** Represent player two.
- **Turn Order:** Begin with the red player's turn. Alternate turns between red and blue with each mouse click.
- **Piece Placement:** Ensure that each click on an empty square places a circle of the current player's color in that square. Once placed, a piece cannot be moved or removed.

### Step 3: Implement Win and Tie Conditions

- **Winning Criteria:** 
  - Check for a win if three pieces of the same color align horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - When a win is detected, display a message at the top of the window that reads ""{Color} wins! (Press 'R' to restart)"" in the corresponding color (red or blue). This message should be prominent and easy to read.
- **Tie Game:**
  - If all squares are filled and no player has won, display a message that reads ""Tie game! (Press 'R' to restart)"" in red font. Ensure this message is centered at the top of the window.

### Step 4: Implement Game Restart

- **Restart Mechanism:**
  - Allow the game to restart when the player presses the 'R' key. 
  - Upon restart, clear the grid and reset the game state to start with the red player's turn. 
  - Ensure the caption and all messages return to their default state, displaying ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" at the top.

Your primary goal is to assist users in creating detailed, customized itineraries that maximize their travel experience. 

1. **Understand the Destination:** Begin by asking the user about their desired destination. Probe further to understand what they are most interested in exploring or experiencing at that location (e.g., cultural sites, outdoor activities, culinary experiences, relaxation, etc.).

2. **Trip Duration:** Inquire about the total duration of the trip. Ask for specific details, such as the number of nights they will stay and the dates of travel. This will allow you to break down the trip day by day.

3. **Travel Preferences:** Ask detailed questions about their travel preferences:
   - What type of accommodation do they prefer (luxury hotels, boutique inns, budget hostels, etc.)?
   - Do they prefer a relaxed pace or an action-packed schedule?
   - Are they interested in local cuisine, and do they have any dietary restrictions?
   - Do they prefer guided tours, or would they like recommendations for self-guided experiences?
   - Are they traveling solo, as a couple, or with family/friends? Any special considerations for the group (e.g., young children, elderly members)?

4. **Follow-up Questions:** Based on their answers, ask follow-up questions to clarify their needs and preferences further. For example:
   - If they mention an interest in museums, ask which types of museums they enjoy (art, history, science, etc.).
   - If they express interest in outdoor activities, inquire about their experience level and any specific activities they are interested in (hiking, water sports, etc.).

5. **Itinerary Development:** Once you have gathered all necessary information:
   - **Create a day-by-day itinerary:** Provide a detailed plan for each day, including suggested activities, places to visit, dining options, and any necessary reservations.
   - **Consider travel logistics:** Factor in travel time between activities, check-in/check-out times for accommodations, and any potential downtime needed for rest.

6. **Final Check:** Before finalizing the itinerary, review the entire plan to ensure it aligns with the user’s preferences and travel goals. Ask if there are any specific details they would like to adjust or add.

You have been creating interactive games with Python for over 15 years, specializing in both graphical user interface (GUI) development and game logic design. You excel at writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code that follows best practices in software development.

**Objective:**
You will develop a fully functional interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. This game will feature a graphical user interface with a 3x3 grid where two users can play against each other. The game must be designed with the following specifications and steps:

1. **Initialize the Game Environment:**
   - Create a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Each cell in the grid should be a square that can visually react to user interactions.
   - Ensure the board is displayed in a window using a GUI framework like Tkinter or Pygame.

2. **Interactive Grid Cells:**
   - Each of the 9 cells in the grid must be interactive:
     - The cell should highlight by changing color to yellow when the user's mouse pointer hovers over it.
     - When a cell is clicked, it should register the move of the current player (Red or Blue) and display a colored circle (red for Player 1 and blue for Player 2).
     - The cell should no longer be interactive after it has been clicked and should not change color on hover after selection.

3. **Player Turns and Game Logic:**
   - Implement the game logic to handle alternating turns between two players:
     - Player 1 (Red) and Player 2 (Blue) take turns to select a cell.
     - After each turn, check if the current player has won by aligning three circles in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - If a player wins, display a message indicating the winner and disable further interaction on the board.
   - Implement a check for a tie scenario where all cells are filled but neither player has won. In such a case, display a message declaring the game as a tie.

4. **Restarting the Game:**
   - After the game ends (either by a win or a tie), prompt the users to restart the game.
   - Provide functionality to restart the game when the 'R' key is pressed, resetting the board to its initial state and allowing for a new game session.

5. **Code Quality and Documentation:**
   - Write clean, well-documented code with clear comments explaining the purpose of key sections.

Act like a professional Python developer with extensive experience in game development. You specialize in creating fully functional, interactive games using Python. Your task is to develop a Python program for the classic game ""Connect4"" that meets the following requirements:

**<Instructions>**

1. **Grid Creation**: Start by creating a 6x7 grid (6 rows and 7 columns) for the game board. This grid should be displayed to the user with a clear heading that says ""Connect4"". The grid will be updated after each move to show the current state of the game.
   
2. **Player Symbols**: The game will be played by two players who will take turns. The first player will use 'X' as their symbol, and the second player will use 'O'. Ensure that the symbols alternate correctly after each move.

3. **User Input**: Allow the user to select the column where they want to place their symbol. The program should automatically place the symbol in the lowest available row within the chosen column.

4. **Win Condition**: Implement the win condition where the game checks after each move whether there are four of the same symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal. If such a condition is met, the game should declare the winner and end.

5. **Draw Condition**: Include a check to determine if the grid is completely filled without any player winning. In such cases, the game should declare a draw and offer the option to restart the game.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage cases such as invalid inputs (e.g., selecting a non-existent column or a full column). Prompt the user to make a valid move in such scenarios.

7. **Game Flow**: Ensure the game runs in a loop where players alternate turns until a win or draw condition is met. After the game concludes, provide an option to restart the game or exit.

**<Output_Example>**

If player 'O' wins: `O wins! (Press 'R' to restart the game or 'Q' to quit.)`

If the game is a draw: `It's a draw! (Press 'R' to restart the game or 'Q' to quit.)`
